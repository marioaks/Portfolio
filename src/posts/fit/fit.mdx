title: FIT – An AI driven platform to modernize commercial real estate brokerage
subtitle: Commercial real estate brokerage is an old-fashion industry that is starting to experience a wave of innovation. AI tools able to process massive amounts of data are introducing efficiencies that weren’t previously possible. Commercial brokerages are beginning to realize that if they don’t become data, tech, and AI leaders, they will be left behind.  For the most part however, these brokerages are made up of data-illiterate brokers whose instincts often lead to decisions that are neither good for their clients nor the neighborhoods they do their work in. In this case study, I will talk about how I helped build FIT, an AI-driven platform meant to both provide unique efficiencies into brokers’ workloads and nudge them into better decision-making.
