description: An attempt at understanding Andrew Wiles's proof of Fermat's enigmatic Last Theorem. 

title: "Understanding Fermat's Last Theorem"
subtitle: The Pythagorean Theorem is one of the most basic fundamental relations of Euclidian Geometry. Students at a young age are taught that, for any right triangle, the square of its hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of each of its other two sides. The equation a^2 + b^2 = c^2 contains an infinite number of integer solutions, something that is relatively easy to prove. From this simple looking equation however, arose a conundrum that perplexed mathematicians for 350 years. What if instead of solving the Pythagorean relation, we wanted to find integer solutions to a^3 + b^3 = c^3 or a^4 + b^4 = c^4 and so on? Herein lies Fermat’s Last Theorem. Pierre de Fermat conjectured that there are no integer solutions to the equation a^n + b^n = c^n for all n > 2. Up until 1995, when a British mathematician by the name of Andrew Wiles proved the conjecture to be correct, this theorem was considered the most famous unproven conjecture ever made.

Pierre de Fermat was born in Beaumont-de-Lomagne, France on August 17th, 1601. Along with Rene Descartes, he was one of the two leading and most accomplished mathematicians of the early 17th Century. Unlike Descartes however, Fermat practiced mathematics, not as his profession, but rather just as a hobby. While we now consider him to be one of the greatest mathematical minds in history and the first true number theorist, he was in fact a lawyer by trade. Only in his spare time would he devise a wide range of theorems and conjectures that would forever change the course of mathematics. Fermat, however, was not very organized with recording all of these conjectures and proofs. Many of his them were found in letters sent to his friends and family, but the most significant ones were written down in the margins of a copy of the book ”Arithmetica” by Diophantus. Fermat wrote his last theorem in the margins of the book along with the comment, “Hanc marginis exiguitas non caperet”, meaning ”I have a truly marvelous proof which this margin is too narrow to contain.” Soon after he wrote that, Pierre de Fermat died and left the world to wonder whether or not he truly had a proof to this deceivingly unimaginably challenging problem. As people rediscovered all of Fermat’s conjectures in the margins of ”Arithmetica”, mathematicians began trying to prove all of them. One by one, all of Fermat’s conjectures were verified, and the only one that nobody could prove happened to be Fermat’s Last Theorem.

It wasn’t until 350 years later, when a bright ten-year-old boy became obsessed with Fermat’s Last Theorem, that the problem that confounded generations would be solved. Ten-year-old Andrew Wiles read a book called ”The Last Problem” by ET Bell and became passionate about being the first to come up with a proof for the theorem. Caught up in his schooling, Wiles forgot about the theorem for a while, but always kept it in the back of his mind. He completed his PHD in mathematics and became a Princeton professor, but as soon as the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil conjecture was proposed, Wiles's old passion was reinvigorated. Essentially, it was shown that if anyone proved the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil conjecture about modularity, one would also prove Fermat’s Last Theorem. Wiles worked tirelessly in secret for seven years, and eventually, in 1995, came up with a proof for the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil conjecture, and thus also proved Fermat’s Last Theorem. While there was a mistake in Wiles’s first proof, he fixed it a year later and has gone down as one of the best mathematicians of the 20th century.

At the heart of Andrew Wiles’s proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem is the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil conjecture. Proving Taniyama-Shimura-Weil (now called modularity) is immensely complicated and the only way to elucidate the proof in a paper of this scope is to simplify everything a great deal. Accordingly, a very basic explanation of what the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil conjecture says is that every rational elliptic curve is modular. In other words, it explains that you can fit a modular form into a elliptic curve.
To understand the concept of what a modular form is, imagine we have an infinite plane that you can cut up into an infinite number of strips of equal width. If an equation is drawn on the plane, the equation would be considered a modular form if it is possible to cut up the plane into the equal strips in way that all the strips have the exact same pattern on them. Take, for example, a sine curve. If the sine function were to be drawn on the plane, we cut the plane into an infinite number of strips where each strip has a width of the size of the period of the sine function. In this way, each strip perfectly resembles what is drawn on all the other strips. Therefore, a modular form has translational symmetry. This is a very simplified explanation of modular forms because in reality, modular forms belong to hyperbolic space, which isn’t flat like a plane. Nonetheless, this explanation provides a decent understanding of the symmetry of a modular form.

The other part of the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil conjecture concerns elliptic curves. An elliptic curve is a curve given by the form y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B. What is important to note is that we can construct elliptic curves from Fermat’s Last Theorem equation. In other words, if there was an integer solution to a^n + b^n = c^n, we could construct a cubic function y^2 = x(x + a^n)(x − b^n) that relates to it. Since this equation is of the same form as an elliptic curve, we know that there is an elliptic curve associated to any counterexample of Fermat’s Last Theorem equation. Using these two equations, Kenneth Ribet, a Professor at the University of California, Berkley, proved that if there is solution to a^n + b^n = cn for n > 2, then y^2 = x(x + a^n)(x − b^n) could not be modular. This proof was remarkable because now, if someone proved the Taniyama-Shimura- Weil conjecture that states that all elliptical curves are modular, they would show that there are no counterexamples to Fermat’s Last Theorem.

So, what does it mean for an elliptic curve to be modular? It essentially means that you can fit a modular form into an elliptic curve. This is a complicated concept, but in order to visualize it, try to imagine a two-dimensional plane at the bottom of a three-dimensional world. Lets now use a circle as a our hypothetical example of an elliptic curve. In real life, a circle is not an elliptic curve, but we can use it to explain the modularity of elliptic curves in a simple way. We can draw this circle on the bottom 2D plane. Now, at a constant rate, we can use a pencil to trace the circle on the plane repeatedly. While we are tracing the circle, imagine that the plane is moving up the 3D world, and as we trace it, we begin drawing a new form in the 3D world. When the plane gets to the top and we stop tracing, we have essentially drawn what looks like a coil or a slinky of the same width as the original circle. Assuming there are no perspective issues in the 3D world, if we went to the top and looked directly down the new coil that we made, we wouldn’t see a coil, but we would instead see a 2D circle. The coil is modular since it can go on forever and can be split up into an infinite number of strips that all have the same pattern. So, what we have essentially shown is that a modular form can be disguised as an elliptic curve if we change the space we are observing it. The Taniyama-Shimura conjecture stated that all elliptic curves are modular and Ribet proved that any elliptic curve derived from Fermat’s Last Theorem cannot be modular.

The proof to Taniyama-Shimura took Andrew Wiles seven years to prove, but its impact was profound. Not only did Wiles manage to show that Fermat’s theorem was correct all along, he also merged two distinct mathematical worlds together. His proof is the Rosetta Stone of mathematics. Now, if someone proves something in the elliptic world, something else can also be said about the modular world as well. This proof helps show the relationship between different branches of mathematics and illuminates how harmonious math really is.
